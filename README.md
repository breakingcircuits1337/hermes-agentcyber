**Hermes AgentCyber is a cybersecurity-focused fork of [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) — the self-improving AI agent by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It adds a native cybersecurity toolkit (threat intelligence, IOC extraction, vulnerability triage, incident response) and a live USB system that boots any x86-64 PC into an autonomous cyber operations environment. The base agent's learning loop, multi-platform gateway, and subagent delegation are all intact.

Use any model — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, or your own endpoint. Switch with `hermes model` — no lock-in.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Cybersecurity toolkit</b></td><td>Native tools for CVE lookup (NVD), IOC reputation (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB), MITRE ATT&CK TTP lookup, IOC extraction from logs/reports, CVSS+EPSS vulnerability triage, and an in-session incident response playbook. All in the <code>cyber</code> toolset — no wiring required.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Live USB — plug in and act</b></td><td>Build a bootable Debian 12 ISO with hermes pre-installed. Boot any PC, complete a 60-second first-boot wizard, and the gateway starts automatically. Three modes: gateway (Telegram/Slack C2), interactive terminal, or headless network scan.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>SOC audit trail</b></td><td>Set <code>HERMES_CYBER_AUDIT=true</code> to get a tamper-evident NDJSON log of every tool call at <code>~/.hermes/logs/cyber_audit.jsonl</code>. Credentials redacted. File mode 0600.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Protected subagent operations</b></td><td>In-flight subagents (parallel CVE triage, recon sweeps) are shielded from accidental interrupts — a follow-up message queues rather than killing running work. <code>/stop</code> still force-cancels everything.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>A real terminal interface</b></td><td>Full TUI with multiline editing, slash-command autocomplete, conversation history, interrupt-and-redirect, and streaming tool output.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Lives where you do</b></td><td>Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, and CLI — all from a single gateway process. Voice memo transcription, cross-platform conversation continuity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>A closed learning loop</b></td><td>Agent-curated memory with periodic nudges. Autonomous skill creation after complex tasks. Skills self-improve during use. FTS5 session search with LLM summarization for cross-session recall. <a href="https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho">Honcho</a> dialectic user modeling. Compatible with the <a href="https://agentskills.io">agentskills.io</a> open standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Delegates and parallelizes</b></td><td>Spawn isolated subagents for parallel workstreams — run simultaneous CVE triage, network scans, and log analysis. Write Python scripts that call tools via RPC, collapsing multi-step pipelines into zero-context-cost turns.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Runs anywhere</b></td><td>Seven terminal backends — local, Docker, SSH, Singularity, Modal, Daytona, and Vercel Sandbox. Or boot directly from the live USB on any x86-64 machine.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Research-ready</b></td><td>Batch trajectory generation, trajectory compression for training the next generation of tool-calling models.</td></tr>

## Cybersecurity Features

### Cyber Toolset

Enable the `cyber` toolset in `config.yaml` to get four purpose-built security tools:

```yaml
toolsets:
  enabled: [cyber, web, terminal, file, delegation]
```

| Tool | What it does | APIs |
|---|---|---|
| `threat_intel` | CVE lookup, IOC reputation, MITRE ATT&CK TTP | NVD v2 (free), VirusTotal (`VT_API_KEY`), AbuseIPDB (`ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`), ATT&CK TAXII (free) |
| `extract_iocs` | Extract IPs, domains, hashes, URLs, CVEs, emails from any text. Handles analyst defanging (`hxxp`, `[.]`, `[at]`). | None — local |
| `vuln_triage` | CVSS + EPSS exploitation probability + asset matching → CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority | NVD v2 (free), EPSS first.org (free) |
| `ir_incident` | IR state machine: create incident, timeline, evidence log, markdown report | None — in-session |

**Example — triage a CVE from Telegram:**
```
"Is CVE-2024-3400 critical for my Palo Alto firewalls?"
→ vuln_triage correlates CVSS 10.0 + EPSS 94th percentile + asset match
→ Returns: CRITICAL — patch immediately (within 24 hours)
```

**Example — parse a phishing email:**
```
"Here's the raw email [paste]. What's in it?"
→ extract_iocs pulls IPs, domains, URLs, hashes
→ threat_intel checks each IOC's reputation in parallel via delegate_task
→ ir_incident opens a P2 incident and logs all IOCs as evidence
```

### Cybersecurity Skills

Three agent playbooks live in `skills/cybersecurity/` and are available as slash commands:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `threat-intel` | Full TI synthesis workflow: extract → enrich in parallel → map to ATT&CK → brief |
| `ir-copilot` | End-to-end IR lifecycle: triage → investigation → containment → report |
| `vuln-triage` | CVE backlog prioritisation with bulk parallel triage pattern |

### SOC Audit Log

```bash
export HERMES_CYBER_AUDIT=true
hermes gateway start
```

Every `agent:step` (tool name + redacted inputs + result preview) and `agent:end` (stop reason, token counts) is appended to `~/.hermes/logs/cyber_audit.jsonl` in NDJSON format. The file is created with mode `0600`. Rotate externally with `logrotate`.

### Optional API Keys

Add to `~/.hermes/.env` — all cyber tools degrade gracefully when keys are absent:

```bash
VT_API_KEY=your-virustotal-key        # IOC reputation via VirusTotal
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your-abuseipdb-key  # IP reputation via AbuseIPDB
```

NVD, EPSS (first.org), and MITRE ATT&CK TAXII are all free with no API key required.

## Live USB

Build a bootable USB that turns any x86-64 PC into a Hermes cyber operations node.

### Build the ISO

Requires a Linux host with `debootstrap`, `squashfs-tools`, `xorriso`, `grub-efi-amd64-bin`:

```bash
# Install build deps (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install -y debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso \
  grub-efi-amd64-bin grub-pc-bin mtools dosfstools

# Build (bundles the current repo — no internet needed on the target PC)
sudo live-usb/build_iso.sh

# Write to USB (/dev/sdb — check with: sudo live-usb/write_usb.sh --list)
sudo live-usb/write_usb.sh --device /dev/sdb --verify
```

The ISO boots on both UEFI and legacy BIOS systems. Default size is ~2 GB.

### Boot Modes (GRUB menu, 5 s timeout)

| Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Gateway** | First-boot wizard → configures Telegram token + API key → `hermes-gateway.service` starts → take commands from your phone |
| **Terminal** | First-boot wizard → drops into interactive `hermes` agent shell |
| **Headless scan** | Skips wizard, reads provisioned config → autonomous network discovery → CVE triage → IR report saved to `~/hermes-scan-<date>.md` |
| **Forensic** | `noautomount noswap` — safe for evidence collection; no drives auto-mounted |
| **Persistence** | Changes survive reboots via `casper-rw` partition |

### Pre-provision (fleet / ops deployment)

Skip the first-boot wizard entirely by injecting credentials before deployment:

```bash
# From config directory
sudo live-usb/provision.sh --usb /dev/sdb --config ~/.hermes

# From individual flags
sudo live-usb/provision.sh --usb /dev/sdb \
  --telegram-token "7xxx:AAA..." \
  --allowed-users "123456789" \
  --model-key "sk-ant-..." \
  --audit
```

The provisioned config is written to a small FAT32 partition after the ISO. On first boot, the wizard detects it and starts the gateway automatically.

### From Inside the Agent

The `live_usb` tool lets you orchestrate USB creation from a chat message:

```bash
hermes tools --enable live_usb
```

```
"List my USB drives"         → live_usb(action="list_usb")
"Check if I can build"       → live_usb(action="status")
"Build a headless-scan ISO"  → live_usb(action="build", headless_scan=true)
"Write it to /dev/sdb"       → live_usb(action="write", device="/dev/sdb")
"Provision with my config"   → live_usb(action="provision", device="/dev/sdb", config="~/.hermes")
```

### On the Running USB

```bash
hermes-live start / stop / restart / status / logs
hermes-live scan 192.168.1.0/24    # ad-hoc cyber sweep → markdown report
hermes-live shell                   # drop into interactive agent
hermes-live config                  # edit ~/.hermes/config.yaml
```

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell) — Early Beta

> **Heads up:** Native Windows support is **early beta**. It installs and runs, but hasn't been road-tested as broadly as our Linux/macOS/WSL2 paths. Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues) when you hit rough edges. For the most battle-tested Windows setup today, run the Linux/macOS one-liner above inside **WSL2**.

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install).  Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead.  Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Hermes installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is supported as an **early beta** — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything, but expect rough edges and please file issues when you hit them. If you'd rather use WSL2 (our most battle-tested Windows path), the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux.  The only Hermes feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively).

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes              # start chatting!
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal status`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

---

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `hermes` | Run `hermes gateway setup` + `hermes gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
